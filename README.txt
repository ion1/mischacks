= MiscHacks

* http://johan.kiviniemi.name/software/mischacks/

== DESCRIPTION:

sh::        Safely pass untrusted parameters to sh scripts.
overwrite:: Safely replace a file.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

The sh method is only safe if your sh script is safe. If unsure, add double
quotation marks around all variable references ("$1", "$foo", "$@"), and never,
ever use an untrusted variable as a command.

== SYNOPSIS:

  # sh

  MiscHacks.sh %q{
    diff -u "$1" "$2" | tr a-z A-Z >"$output"
  }, '/dev/null', '/etc/motd', :output => 'foo'

  unsafe_str = %q{" 'foo' $(bar) `baz` "}
  MiscHacks.sh 'printf "%s\n" "$1"', unsafe_str

  # overwrite

  MiscHacks.overwrite 'myconfig' do |io|
    io << config.to_yaml
  end

== REQUIREMENTS:

* POSIX sh
* A system that implements fork

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install ion1-mischacks --source http://gems.github.com/
