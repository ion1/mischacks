== DESCRIPTION:

Miscellaneous methods that may or may not be useful.

sh:: Safely pass untrusted parameters to sh scripts.

fork_and_check:: Run a block in a forked process and raise an exception if the
process returns a non-zero value.

do_and_exit, do_and_exit!:: Run a block. If the block does not run exit!, a
successful exec or equivalent, run exit(1) or exit!(1) ourselves. Useful to
make sure a forked block either runs a successful exec or dies.

Any exceptions from the block are printed to standard error.

overwrite:: Safely replace a file. Writes to a temporary file and then moves it
over the old file.

tempname_for:: Generates an unique temporary path based on a filename. The
generated filename resides in the same directory as the original one.

try_n_times:: Retries a block of code until it succeeds or a maximum number of
attempts (default 10) is exceeded.

Exception#to_formatted_string:: Returns a string that looks like how Ruby would
dump an uncaught exception.

IO#best_datasync:: Tries fdatasync, falling back to fsync, falling back to
flush.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

The sh method is only safe if your sh script is safe. If unsure, add double
quotation marks around all variable references ("$1", "$foo", "$@"), and never,
ever use an untrusted variable as a command.

== SYNOPSIS:

  # sh

  MiscHacks.sh %q{
    diff -u "$1" "$2" | tr a-z A-Z >"$output"
  }, '/dev/null', '/etc/motd', :output => 'foo'

  unsafe_str = %q{" 'foo' $(bar) `baz` "}
  MiscHacks.sh 'printf "%s\n" "$1"', unsafe_str

  # fork_and_check

  # These examples raise MiscHacks::ChildError.
  MiscHacks.fork_and_check do exit! 42 end
  MiscHacks.fork_and_check do exec 'sh', '-c', 'exit 42' end
  MiscHacks.fork_and_check do exec 'failure' end

  # Does not raise an error.
  MiscHacks.fork_and_check do exit! 0 end

  # do_and_exit

  # Prints foo if there are no failures. If anything fails, raises an
  # exception.
  MiscHacks.fork_and_check do
    MiscHacks.do_and_exit! do
      exec 'sh', '-c', 'echo foo'
    end
  end

  # overwrite

  MiscHacks.overwrite 'myconfig' do |io|
    io << config.to_yaml
  end

  # tempname_for

  MiscHacks.tempname_for '/foo/bar/baz'  # => '/foo/bar/.baz.klyce3f517qkh9l'

  # try_n_times

  io = MiscHacks.try_n_times do
    File.open path, File::RDWR|File::CREAT|File::EXCL
  end

  # Exception#to_formatted_string

  begin
    # Do something
  rescue => e
    warn e.to_formatted_string
  end
